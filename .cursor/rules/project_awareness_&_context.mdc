Project Awareness & Context

- Always read `PLANNING.md` at the start of a new conversation to understand the project's architecture, goals, style, and constraints.

- Check `TASK.md` before starting a new task. If the task isn't listed, add it with a brief description and today's date.

- Use consistent naming conventions, file structure, and architecture patterns as described in `PLANNING.md`.
